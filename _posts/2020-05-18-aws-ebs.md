## EBS
- Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on
- Default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when instance is terminated
- Additional storage attached is not terminated automatically
- EBS root volumes of your default AMI can be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool (bit locker) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMI in the AWS console or using API)
- Additional volume can be encrypted

### EBS Snapshot
- Volumes exist on EBS, think of it as a virtual hard disk
- Snapshot exist on S3
- Snapshot are point in time copies of volumes
- Snapshot are incremental ie.e only the blocks th at have changes since your last snapshot are moved to S3
- First snapshot may take some time to create
- Recommended to stop instance before snapshot to be consistent, but you could always snapshot without stopping
- Can create AMI from both volumes and snapshot
- Can change EBS volume size, and storage type on demand
- Volumes will always be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance

### Migrating EBS
- To move an EC2 volume from one AZ to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then use the AMI to launch the EC2 instance in a new AZ
- To move an EC2 volume from one region to another, take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then copy the AMI from one region to the other. Thne use the copied AMI to launch the new EC2 instance in the new region

### EBS Encryption
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshot are encrypted automatically
- Snapshot can only be shared if they are un-encrypted
- Snapshot can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
