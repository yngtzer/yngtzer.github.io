### Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

> What is EBS ?

A block storage service designed to use with EC2 for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads.

> Why use EBS ?

- Easy to use
- High performance
- Mission critical systems

> What benefits does EBS have ?

- Replicated within an AZ
- Can easily scale to petabytes of data
- Use EBS Snapshots with *automated lifecycle policies* to back up volumns in S3, while ensuring geographic protection of data and business continuity

> Take Note
> - EBS root volumes of your default AMI can be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool (bit locker) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMI in the AWS console or using API)
> - Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on
> - Default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when instance is terminated
> - Additional volume can be encrypted as well
> - Volumes exist on EBS, think of it as a virtual hard disk

### EBS Snapshot

> What is EBS Snapshot ?

- To back up the data on EBS volume(s) to S3 by taking point-in-time snapshots
- Snapshot exist on S3
- Snapshot are point in time copies of volumes
- Snapshot are incremental 
  - i.e. only the blocks that have changes since your last snapshot are moved to S3
- Multi-volume snaphots
  - i.e. to create back up for workloads that span across multiple EBS volumes.

> Take Note 
> - First snapshot may take some time to create
> - Recommended to stop instance before snapshot to be consistent, but you could without it
> - AMI can be created from both volumes and snapshot
> - EBS volume size, and storage type can be change on demand
> - Volumes will always be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance

> What goes behide the scene when creating an EBS volume based on a snapshot ?
> 
>> The new volume begins as an exact replica of the original volume that was used to 
>> create the snapshot. The replicated volume loads data in the background so that
>> you can begin using it immediately. If you access data that hasn't been loaded 
>> yet, the volume immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, and then 
>> continues loading the rest of the volume's data in the background.

### Migrating EBS

> Move from one AZ to another

Take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then use the AMI to launch the EC2 instance in a new AZ

> Move from one region to another

Take a snapshot of it, create an AMI from the snapshot and then copy the AMI from one region to the other. Then use the copied AMI to launch the new EC2 instance in the new region

### EBS Encryption
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshot are encrypted automatically
- Snapshot can only be shared if they are un-encrypted
- Snapshot can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
